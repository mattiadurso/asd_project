The proposed problem asks to calculate the weighted (lower) median of a set of positive rational numbers. You are asked to receive the values via standard input and print them on the screen via standard output.
We consider n values w_1 ... w_n, and denote by W = Î£_(i = 1 -> n) w_i their sum.
Given w_1 ... w_n and having calculated the sum W, the lower weighted median is the smallest value such that the sum of all ordered values preceding w_i is less than half of the sum W.
